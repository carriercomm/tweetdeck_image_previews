TweetDeck Instgram Previews
================

The [Tweetdeck Web App](http://web.tweetdeck.com) has stopped displayin inline image previews for tweets continaing 
Instgram links. This is probably to do with the great [Twitter/Instagram war](http://status.twitter.com/post/37258637900/instagram-photo-rendering-issue).

So here is some hacky Javascript to add Instagram previews back. I may get round to adding support for more image providers
like Imgur. And well, any type of image that ends in a valid image extension, why not eh?

## Installation 
### Chrome/Tampermonkey

Install [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) Google Chrome extension has been installed.

Then add the `tip.user.js` file as a new userscript.

### Firefox/Greasemonkey

Install [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) Firefox add-on has been installed.

Add the `tip.user.js` file as a new userscript.
